# Etch-A-Sketch

`A webpage with a Grid of square divs.`

- Creates the divs using JavaScript.
- Put your grid squares inside another “container” div (which can go directly in your HTML).
- Make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line). 
- This is a perfect opportunity to apply flexbox.
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
- There are multiple ways to change the color of the divs, including:
    - adding a new class to the div.
    - changing the div’s background color using JavaScript.

- Adds a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
